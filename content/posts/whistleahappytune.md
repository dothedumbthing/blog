[The old fake it til you make it may indeed be an effective strategy for many](https://www.bustle.com/articles/11688-fake-it-til-you-make-it-why-faking-confidence-is-actually-a-really-good-strategy-at), however I am of the opinion that its application to any practical craft has been misinterpreted as a shortcut way to bypass the necessary work that brings adequate skill, from whence true confidence allegedly emanates - if I fake it I might as well be doing it, so watch me fly. So what happens if the faking isn't any good? You can't fake a lack of skill (ehm...). But what about a lack of confidence or self-assurance, even when the skill is more than sufficient and up to the task? There is where the true, scientifically tested effect of the tired adage may actually serve us with its true potential. Affirmations do indeed work wonders, because if I don't believe in myself, who else will?

I am aware this probably applies to most people in other fields, but I can only speak for myself (those who claim not to be affected by this, are in fact faking it til they make it, or did it for so long that they forgot how to be self-aware) when I admit that self-doubt and feelings of insufficiency do invade my mind from time to time, never welcome, always striking at the moments when I feel most vulnerable - unsurprisingly, one does not usually feel insecure when things are going really well. It's only when things go pear-shaped, when our skill is tested, that we tend to feel most unable to put that same skill that will steer us on the right direction to good use (isn't that funny?). When this happens to me, I remind myself that the job of a Music Director is not only to do the thing they’ve been hired to do, the sound-related stuff some like to exclusively focus on, but also to inspire others to do theirs as best they can. 

It's easy to fake it when things are going well. Not so much so when things goes sideways, and that's when it is most needed.

So much of my output as an MD is communicated without words. In fact, i cannot really talk much whilst I am doing the deed. Instead I have to resort to more sublte tools: through body language, facial expressions, and my general demeanor. A cue, a nod, a smile. And when so much of that is left to the interpretetion of an intentional receiver (they are following you!) you simply can’t afford to look like you’re freaking out, like you don't have it together, no matter how much you might feel that way deep inside where you feel your flutters, or how many clues your body is giving away inadvertently: pursed lips, unnoticed tension, or maybe a concerning blue-tinge caused a record-shattering ten minutes of no breathing that would put the best apnoea finswimmers to shame.

MDs are in the business of solving problems no one knew they had. And some times, we are way too unaware we may be getting on the way with our own non-verbal projections.

Imagine getting on a plane, only to be greeted by a dishevelled pilot, bags under their eyes from sleep deprivation, as he shakily announces: "Welcome, I guess. I hope we make it to destination!". Please, no. There's turbulance ahead, and we will be fine. 

So when the going gets rough, when the voice at the back of my head interrupts my flow from the place where the doubts inhibittedly inhabit, usually behind a sweaty brow and a twitchy eye, arrogantly asserts: we are scared! I like to invoke the wisdom of Oscar Hammerstein II (I choose my gods fittingly, see below), and *I whistle a Happy Tune*. 

And the doubt-me, the fear-me, that so natural part of me-me that makes me me, so intent in keeping me safe from the self-afflicted dangers of the mind, as it begs me to stand up and run as far as I can, suddenly sees the way: through and only through. Only when I regain that focus, then I can continue doing the dumb thing. And help others do their own as best they can.

Sounds easy, but it's hard: to get out of everybody else's way, I just have to get out of my own way first. Cool as a cucumber, whilst everything else threatens to fall apart any minute now, I remember the mantra:

## *"I Whistle a Happy Tune"*
Whenever I feel afraid,  
I hold my head erect  
And whistle a happy tune,  
So no one will suspect  
I’m afraid.  

While shivering in my shoes,  
I strike a careless pose  
And whistle a happy tune  
And no one ever knows  
I’m afraid.  

The result of this deception  
Is very strange to tell,  
For when I fool the people I fear,  
I fool myself as well!  

I whistle a happy tune,  
And ev’ry single time  
The happiness in the tune  
Convinces me that I’m  
Not afraid!  

Make believe you’re brave  
And the trick will take you far;  
You may be as brave  
As you make believe you are.  

You may be as brave  
As you make believe you are.
