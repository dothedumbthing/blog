[Faking it may and does work sometimes indeed](https://www.bustle.com/articles/11688-fake-it-til-you-make-it-why-faking-confidence-is-actually-a-really-good-strategy-at), but no amount of pretending can ever replace adequate preparation, skill, or genuine confidence. However much of that you put in, it may still never be enough to feel fully at ease on the podium.

Self-doubt and feelings of insufficiency do invade my mind at any time, never welcome, always striking at the moments when I feel most vulnerable - indeed, one does not usually feel insecure when things are going well. It's only when things go pear-shaped, when our skill is tested, that we tend to feel most unable to put that same skill that will steer us on the right direction to good use (isn't that funny?). When this happens to me, I remind myself that the job of a Music Director is not only to do the thing they’ve been hired to do, the sound-related stuff some like to exclusively focus on, but also to inspire others to do theirs as best they can.

So much of an MD’s output is communicated without words: through body language, facial expression, and demeanor. You simply can’t afford to look like you’re falling apart, no matter how much you might feel that way inside, or how much of your body is giving away inadvertently, pursed lips, unnoticed tension. 

MDs are in the business of solving problems no one knew they had. 

So when the going gets rough, when the voice at the back of my head interrupts my flow from the place where the doubts inhibittedly inhabit, usually behind a sweaty brow and a twitchy eye, arrogantly asserts: we are scared! I like to invoke the wisdom of Oscar Hammerstein II (I choose my gods fittingly), and I whistle a happy tune (even if only quietly, in my head). And the doubt-me, the fear-me, that so natural part of me-me that makes me me, the part that insists in keeping me safe from the dangers of the mind, begging me to stand up and run as far as I can, sees the way: through and only through. Only when I regain that focus, then I can continue doing the dumb thing.

Sometimes I just have to get out of my own way. The lyrics are the mantra.

## *"I Whistle a Happy Tune"* — Lyrics

Whenever I feel afraid,  
I hold my head erect  
And whistle a happy tune,  
So no one will suspect  
I’m afraid.  

While shivering in my shoes,  
I strike a careless pose  
And whistle a happy tune  
And no one ever knows  
I’m afraid.  

The result of this deception  
Is very strange to tell,  
For when I fool the people I fear,  
I fool myself as well!  

I whistle a happy tune,  
And ev’ry single time  
The happiness in the tune  
Convinces me that I’m  
Not afraid!  

Make believe you’re brave  
And the trick will take you far;  
You may be as brave  
As you make believe you are.  

You may be as brave  
As you make believe you are.
