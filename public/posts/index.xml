      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bustle.com/articles/11688-fake-it-til-you-make-it-why-faking-confidence-is-actually-a-really-good-strategy-at&#34;&gt;Faking it may and does work sometimes&lt;/a&gt;, but no amount of pretending can ever replace preparation, skill, or genuine confidence. However much of that you put in, it may even never be enough to feel at ease on the podium. Self-doubt and feelings of insufficiency can invade our minds at any time, and they’re always unwelcome.When this happens to me, I remind myself that the job of a Music Director is not only to &lt;em&gt;do the thing&lt;/em&gt; they&amp;rsquo;ve been hired to do, but also to &lt;strong&gt;inspire others to do theirs as best they can&lt;/strong&gt;. So much of an MD&amp;rsquo;s output is purely based on their body language, their facial expression, their demeanor. You simply can’t afford to look like you’re falling apart, no matter how much you might feel that way inside. As we like to put it, we are in the business of solving problems no one knew they had before they could even realise they happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
