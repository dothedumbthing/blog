      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bustle.com/articles/11688-fake-it-til-you-make-it-why-faking-confidence-is-actually-a-really-good-strategy-at&#34;&gt;Faking it may and does work sometimes indeed&lt;/a&gt;, but no amount of pretending can ever replace adequate preparation, skill, or genuine confidence. However much of that you put in, it may still never be enough to feel fully at ease on the podium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-doubt and feelings of insufficiency do invade my mind at any time, never welcome, always striking at the moments when I feel most vulnerable - indeed, one does not usually feel insecure when things are going well. It&amp;rsquo;s only when things go pear-shaped, when our skill is tested, that we tend to feel most unable to put that same skill that will steer us on the right direction to good use (isn&amp;rsquo;t that funny?). When this happens to me, I remind myself that the job of a Music Director is not only to do the thing theyâ€™ve been hired to do, the sound-related stuff some like to exclusively focus on, but also to inspire others to do theirs as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
