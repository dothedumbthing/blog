You simply can’t afford to look like you’re falling apart, no matter how much you might feel that way inside, or how much of your body is giving away inadvertently, pursed lips, unnoticed tension.\nMDs are in the business of solving problems no one knew they had.\nSo when the going gets rough, when the voice at the back of my head interrupts my flow from the place where the doubts inhibittedly inhabit, usually behind a sweaty brow and a twitchy eye, arrogantly asserts: we are scared! I like to invoke the wisdom of Oscar Hammerstein II (I choose my gods fittingly), and I whistle a happy tune (even if only quietly, in my head). And the doubt-me, the fear-me, that so natural part of me-me that makes me me, the part that insists in keeping me safe from the dangers of the mind, begging me to stand up and run as far as I can, sees the way: through and only through. Only when I regain that focus, then I can continue doing the dumb thing.\nSometimes I just have to get out of my own way. The lyrics are the mantra.\n“I Whistle a Happy Tune” — Lyrics Whenever I feel afraid,\nI hold my head erect\nAnd whistle a happy tune,\nSo no one will suspect\nI’m afraid.\nWhile shivering in my shoes,\nI strike a careless pose\nAnd whistle a happy tune\nAnd no one ever knows\nI’m afraid.\nThe result of this deception\nIs very strange to tell,\nFor when I fool the people I fear,\nI fool myself as well!\nI whistle a happy tune,\nAnd ev’ry single time\nThe happiness in the tune\nConvinces me that I’m\nNot afraid!\nMake believe you’re brave\nAnd the trick will take you far;\nYou may be as brave\nAs you make believe you are.\nYou may be as brave\nAs you make believe you are.\n",

<p>Whenever I feel afraid,<br>
I hold my head erect<br>
And whistle a happy tune,<br>
So no one will suspect<br>
I’m afraid.</p>
<p>While shivering in my shoes,<br>
I strike a careless pose<br>
And whistle a happy tune<br>
And no one ever knows<br>
I’m afraid.</p>
<p>The result of this deception<br>
Is very strange to tell,<br>
For when I fool the people I fear,<br>
I fool myself as well!</p>
<p>I whistle a happy tune,<br>
And ev’ry single time<br>
The happiness in the tune<br>
Convinces me that I’m<br>
Not afraid!</p>
<p>Make believe you’re brave<br>
And the trick will take you far;<br>
You may be as brave<br>
As you make believe you are.</p>
<p>You may be as brave<br>
As you make believe you are.</p>
